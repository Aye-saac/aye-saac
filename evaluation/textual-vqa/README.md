# Data

To evaluate the Textual VQA components of Aye-Saac, we gathered a subset of the [VizWiz dataset](https://vizwiz.org/tasks-and-datasets/vqa/). This subset is currently being uploaded into Heriot-Watt University's data sharing platform, and will then need to be approved by the admins. This is a relatively short process so once ready, we will post the link here.

Until then, the dataset can be accessed [on Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jemxpZdOX9PJTx-rRH72o4z6PeH-dl4R?usp=sharing).
